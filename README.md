# Telecommunication-Tower-Placement-GA
Telecommunication tower is a structure that houses the antennae, dishes and receivers required for wireless communication and data transfer such as radio and TV broadcasting, cellular phone antennas and towers and others. The problem that needs to be solved in this mini project is to optimize the telecommunication signal coverage by placing the telecommunication tower. The placement of the telecommunication tower is important. 

The figure shows a good and bad placement of the telecommunication tower, only the good placement with less overlapping can solve the problem, whereas the bad placement has a big overlapping so it as a wasted tower. This is to make sure that the telecommunication tower can cover the signal in many areas with fewer telecommunication towers placed. Therefore, we use the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve this problem.
